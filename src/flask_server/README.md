# Information:
  Prototype build. This package deal with save and load entity in json string.


  Idea is to handle: 
 * block id's
 * player information
 * map id
 * 

  To handle the object data for query.

# Reason:
  It depend on the save and load data write and read. File vs sqlite. File format take time to write and load. As for sql it easy to save and load once the data is set up.
